Description             : A basic escape/border style map, similar to Hunted.  A US plane goes down near the US/CAN border, 				and a group of pilots are help up in a small village.  It's up to the US troops to help the 				pilots escape back into US.  Canadian Mounties try to stop the pilots from escaping.

* Construction *
------------------------

Base                   	: This map was built from total scratch, using similar ideas from the tfcborder2a map.  The bordering 				trees and fence were used from a .wad pack I found on pipejump2001, so any credits for that 				go to Jobabob's crew.
Editor(s) used         	: Worldcraft 3.3
Known Issues         	: If you are using Software Mode, this map will run extremely slow and sluggish.  If you are not 				using OpenGL and/or don't have a good video card, don't complain to me about your outdated 				hardware.  A minor error with the truck is that it doesn't tilt going up/down the hill, so 				if you are standing near the truck when it goes on the hill, you may be crushed underneath.
